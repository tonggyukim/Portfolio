            <p> I am currently (as of July 2019) a college student going onto my Senior year at the University of Washington. 
            Previous to this boot camp, I had no background in coding nor did I have any desire to do so. 
            However, as a Biology major, although the things that I were learning were interesting, a career in medicine seemed to not fit me. 
            <br>
            This is how I came upon this class, and hopefully I will not only do well, but more importantly enjoy the process. 
            Coming from a family with two computer science majors, I have a lot of not only moral support, but also the help to succeed.
